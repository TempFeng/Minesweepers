## Project Summary
It's a minesweeper solver! It can solve any board, with any size, and exactly compute every cell's chance of being a mine. It achieves this through advanced combinatorial and probability analysis with artificial intelligence. The project will use random search as the baseline algorithm, naive search as the intermediate algorithm and Q-Learning as the advancing algorithm.
